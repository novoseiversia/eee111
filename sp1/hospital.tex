		\subsection{Overview of the program}

			The program is a CLI supply and inventory monitoring program,
			created for a hospital, based on the EEE111 SP1 specifications
			provided. It accepts user input, and allows the following commands
			(in docopt form):

			\begin{verbatim}
			<file_name:str> needed_now
			<file_name:str> needed_in <X:int>
			<file_name:str> runs_out
			<file_name:str> <N:int> run_outs
			help
			exit
			\end{verbatim}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item \verb|<file_name:str> needed_now| prints out the amount needed to fulfill
			the item shortage for the current day.

				\item \verb|<file_name:str needed_in <X:int>| prints out the amount needed to
				fulfill the item shortage for the following \verb|X| days.

				\item \verb|<file_name:str> runs_out| prints out the first item to run out, and
				in how many days it will\footnote{
					These commands will sort in this order in the case of conflicts:
					by amount of days to run out (ascending),
					by amount of deficit (descending),
					and by lexical order of their names (ascending).
				}.

				\item \verb|<file_name:str> run_outs| prints out the virst \verb|N| items to run
				out, and in how many days they will\footnotemark[\value{footnote}].

				\item \verb|help| prints out the help text.

				\item \verb|exit| exits the program.
			\end{itemize}
