	\section{Overview}
		The program is a CLI supply and inventory monitoring program based on
		the EEE111 SP1 specifications provided. It accepts the following commands:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item \verb|<file_name:str> needed_now| --- prints out the amount of items
			needed to fulfill the item shortage for the current day.
			\item \verb|<file_name:str needed_in <X:int>| --- prints out the amount of items
			needed to fulfill the item shortage for the following \verb|X| days.
			\item \verb|<file_name:str> runs_out| --- prints out the first item to run out, and
			in how many days it will.
			\item \verb|<file_name:str> run_outs| --- prints out the first \verb|N| items to run
			out, and in how many days they will.
			\item \verb|help| prints out the help text.
			\item \verb|exit| exits the program.
		\end{itemize}

		The program will accept commands indefinitely, exiting when the \verb|exit| command is
		entered. If an invalid command is entered, the program prints out the help text.
